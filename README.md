**Analysis Overview**
1. Company Introduction and Business Problem
Olist connects small and medium businesses with large e-commerce channels, helping them expand their customer base. The goal is to identify key customer segments, analyze product performance, and understand the impact of payment preferences on consumer behavior.

2. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and splitting/merging columns for analysis. A matrix visualization was used to identify and manage gaps to ensure a reliable foundation for further analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several analyses were conducted, including:
Sales Performance: Trends in product categories, average order value (AOV), and total orders.
Payment Analysis: Payment preferences and revenue distribution by method and region.
Delivery Optimization: Delivery timeline evaluation and its impact on customer satisfaction.
Feedback Analysis: Correlation between product characteristics, delivery time, price, and review scores.

5. Key Findings
Sales Trends: AOV remained stable despite increased order volume, suggesting a broad customer base of price-sensitive consumers.
Payment Preferences: Credit cards dominate higher-value transactions, while vouchers boost customer retention.
Delivery Performance: Improvements in logistics were noted, but late deliveries highlighted areas for enhancement.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): High CLV regions (e.g., AM, SE) indicate potential for growth in other regions through targeted marketing.

7. Recommendations
Product and Pricing Strategy: Focus on high-revenue categories and align stock with demand peaks.
Payment Method Optimization: Promote credit card installments and streamline "boleto" payments for higher customer satisfaction.
Customer Retention: Utilize vouchers as a tool for increasing customer loyalty and repeat purchases.

**Conclusion**
This project highlights opportunities for Olist to optimize their operations and marketing strategies based on customer insights, sales performance, and payment preferences. Recommendations include enhancing logistics, improving product offerings, and tailoring marketing campaigns to high-potential regions.
